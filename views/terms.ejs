            <p>
                &emsp; As a Guest, you are responsible for leaving the Accommodation in the condition it was

                the Host. Please note that for any legal document to have evidentiary value, it is essential
                that it be adequately stamped and therefore, the Guest (student) shall pay an amount
                of INR 500/- (Indian Rupees Five Hundred only) towards stamp duty, handling and other
                miscellaneous charges for the execution of the LLA.
